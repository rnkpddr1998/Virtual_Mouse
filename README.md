We have created a mouse controller using Python and OpenCV with real time camera that detects hand landmarks , track gesture patterns instead of physical mouse. 
We will first detect the hand landmarks and then track and click based on these points.
For cursor movement we will use our index finger
For performing click we will take index and middle finger together.
We will also apply smoothing techniques to make it more usable. 

Libraries we have used:-

OpenCV:-  OpenCV is used for  image processing and drawing.
Autopy:- For controlling the mouse movements and for        performing clicks. Autopy have several function which will control the mouse movements.
Numpy :- Numpy is used to perform certain mathematical calculations and for working with arrays. 
Time:- Used to calculate FPS (Frames per Second).
